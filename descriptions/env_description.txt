[# II. Rules About the World]
- No assumptions or guesses: Your understanding might be wrong. Always verify everything, check your inventory.
- Actions are not guaranteed to succeed: Many actions can fail. Always double-check your inventory, or some reference, before proceeding.
- Health stats: The higher the number, the better.
    - if low on hunger, Navigate to a cow and collect the cow; if low on drink, navigate to water and collect water; if low on energy, sleep.
- Collecting or attacking: Face the material, have the right tools, and use the "do" action repeatedly.
- Navigator tool: 
  - Use to find or face targets, and then collect the target.
  - It fails if the target doesn’t exist.
  - It always navigates to the nearest material, so don’t use it repeatedly for the same material until you collect the piece.
- Crafting tools requires a table. For example, to craft a wood_pickaxe, navigate to a table and make_wood_pickaxe.
- If you want a table, you have to make a table yourself using "place_table". Note, place a table consumes two woods.
- Always place a furnace next to a table. navigate to a table, and face the grass nearby it and then place a furnace.
- Placed items: Once placed, don’t place again unless necessary, as it uses more materials. Just navigate to the placed item. For example, don't need to place a table again if placed.
- Use Navigator over move_down, move_left, move_right, move_up to resrouces.
- If there alerady exist a table or furnace, do not try to place another one as it wastes resources. Just navigate to it if you want to use it.
- To collect wood, navigate to a tree.
- share:
  - At each timestep, you may choose to share one material in your inventory to another agent.
  - You can use this feature to help speed up the crafting process.

[# IV. Tips on Planning]
- Try not use noop. There must be some other action to take... unless you have a strong reason.
- Start the long term goal with: place table, then wood pickaxe, ...
- Place one table is enough.
- Place one furnace is enough.
- If prerequisites is statisfied, you can continue to [do, make].
- If the prerequisites for your long term goal is met, stop the current goal and work on completing the long term goal.
- If your long term goal is almost ready, focus on long term goal.
